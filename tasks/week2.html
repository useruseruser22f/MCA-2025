<h2>Week 2: Notated Music</h2>

<p>For this week's task, I transcribed a portion of Frédéric Chopin’s Preludes, Op. 28 into MuseScore. 
I manually entered at least 10 bars of the score, focusing on pitch accuracy and rhythmic correctness.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Working in MuseScore was mostly intuitive. Selecting note durations, entering pitches, and adjusting accidentals were straightforward, especially using keyboard shortcuts. 
The more complex parts involved handling multiple voices and ensuring slurs and beams matched the original score. 
Overall, the process helped reinforce how musical information—pitch, time, and expressive detail is encoded in notation software.</p>
