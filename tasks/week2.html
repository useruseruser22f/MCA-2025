<h2>Week 2: Notated Music – Cantabile in B-flat major, B.84</h2>

<p>
For this week's task, I selected Frédéric Chopin’s Cantabile in B-flat major, B.84 from my Chopin dataset theme.
I downloaded a public-domain PDF of the score and transcribed it manually into MuseScore.
I entered at least ten bars, concentrating on notating the correct pitches and rhythmic values.
</p>

<h3>Digitising the Score</h3>
<p>
Instead of using OMR software, I chose to transcribe the music directly into MuseScore.
This gave me more control over the notation and ensured that the details of the original score, such as accidentals, note lengths, and bar structure, were entered accurately.
</p>

<h3>Reflection on Transcribing in MuseScore</h3>
<p>
Working in MuseScore was mostly intuitive.
Selecting note values, entering pitches with the mouse and keyboard, and correcting mistakes were all straightforward once I became familiar with the basic tools and shortcuts.
Playback was especially useful for checking whether the rhythms and intervals matched what I saw in the original score.
</p>
<p>
The more challenging aspects involved keeping the notation visually clear and matching the layout of the printed score.
I had to pay attention to beaming, ties, and the spacing of notes within each bar.
Overall, the process helped me understand how information about pitch and time is encoded in digital notation and how closely a MuseScore file can represent a printed score.
