        <h1>Week 8 – Audio Tracks & Time–Frequency Analysis</h1>
        <p>
            This week moves from symbolic notation to <strong>digital audio</strong>.
            I focused on three recordings related to my theme of Frédéric Chopin and
            explored both basic technical metadata and simple time–frequency analysis
            using SonicVisualizer.

        <p>
            I selected three audio tracks related to Chopin. The table below lists
            important technical and non-technical metadata for each track.
            (Values in brackets are reminders for me to fill in based on my audio
            files and SonicVisualizer output.)

        <p>
            The non-technical metadata (title, performer, genre, source and copyright)
            would be useful in a catalogue interface. The technical metadata
            (format, channels, sample rate, bitrate and duration) is more important
            for audio quality, analysis, and storage considerations.

    <!-- TASK 2: WAVEFORMS + SPECTROGRAMS -->
    <section class="box">
        <h2>Task 2 – Waveform vs Time–Frequency (Spectrogram) Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            For each of the three tracks, I opened the audio in SonicVisualizer and
            generated both a waveform view and a log-frequency spectrogram. The images
            below are exported directly from SonicVisualizer.
        </p>

        <h3>Track 1</h3>
        <p><strong>[Replace these image files with your exports]</strong></p>
        <p>Waveform:</p>
        <img src="../img/week8/track1_waveform.png" alt="Track 1 waveform" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
        <p>Spectrogram (log frequency):</p>
        <img src="../img/week8/track1_spectrogram.png" alt="Track 1 spectrogram" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">

        <h3>Track 2</h3>
        <p>Waveform:</p>
        <img src="../img/week8/track2_waveform.png" alt="Track 2 waveform" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
        <p>Spectrogram (log frequency):</p>
        <img src="../img/week8/track2_spectrogram.png" alt="Track 2 spectrogram" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">

        <h3>Track 3</h3>
        <p>Waveform:</p>
        <img src="../img/week8/track3_waveform.png" alt="Track 3 waveform" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
        <p>Spectrogram (log frequency):</p>
        <img src="../img/week8/track3_spectrogram.png" alt="Track 3 spectrogram" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">

        <h3>Short discussion (time–frequency vs waveform)</h3>
        <p>
            A waveform only shows changes in amplitude over time, so it is useful
            for visualising loudness and overall envelope, but it does not tell us
            which pitches or harmonics are present. A log-frequency spectrogram adds
            the frequency axis, which makes it possible to see the distribution of
            energy across low, mid and high ranges at each moment in time. For
            example, in my spectrograms it is much easier to distinguish the left-hand
            bass notes from the right-hand melody, and to see where the pedal creates
            overlapping harmonics. This kind of time–frequency view is therefore much
            more informative for analysing texture, register, and changes in timbre
            than a waveform alone, even though both are derived from the same audio
            signal.
