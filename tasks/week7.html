        <h1>Week 7 – Curating and Displaying Metadata</h1>
        <p>
            In Week 7 I revisited the metadata for my dataset theme
            (<em>Cantabile in B-flat major, B.84</em> by Frédéric Chopin)
            and focused on two curatorial tasks:
            (1) enriching the MEI header with genre and licensing information, and
            (2) learning how to display that metadata on a web page alongside the
            engraved score using Verovio and CETEIcean.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- TASK 1 -->
    <section class="box">
        <h2>Task 1 – Updating the MEI Metadata</h2>
        <p>
            I started from the MEI file I created in Week 5 and saved a new version
            for this lab (<code>chopin-cantabile-meta.mei</code> in my
            <code>data/week7/</code> folder). I then edited the
            <code>&lt;meiHead&gt;</code> to include two additional types of metadata:
            a genre classification and an explicit licence.
        </p>

        <h3>Genre</h3>
        <p>
            I added a genre description inside the <code>&lt;notesStmt&gt;</code> as
            an extra annotation:
        </p>

<pre><code>&lt;notesStmt&gt;
  &lt;annot&gt;
    Encoded for MCA-2025 metadata work. Schema includes title,
    composer, publisher, date, genre and catalogue number.
  &lt;/annot&gt;
  &lt;annot type="genre"&gt;Character piece (cantabile piano work)&lt;/annot&gt;
&lt;/notesStmt&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>
            I chose the label “character piece” because this work is a short,
            lyrical piano solo and is often grouped with Chopin’s other smaller
            character pieces (like nocturnes and preludes). Recording this genre
            in the header means future users can filter my dataset not only by
            composer and key, but also by the type of piece.
        </p>

        <h3>Licensing</h3>
        <p>
            I also added an <code>&lt;availability&gt;</code> element indicating how
            the encoding may be reused:
        </p>

<pre><code>&lt;availability&gt;
  &lt;licence target="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;
    This MEI encoding is released under a Creative Commons
    Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) licence.
  &lt;/licence&gt;
&lt;/availability&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>
            I chose a CC BY-SA licence because the source score is in the public
            domain, but I still want people who reuse my encoding to give credit
            and to share any derivative encodings under the same open licence.
            This is a realistic choice for teaching and research datasets, where
            reuse and adaptation are encouraged but attribution still matters.
        </p>

        <p>
            After adding these elements I revalidated the MEI in Verovio to ensure
            there were no schema errors.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- TASK 2 -->
    <section class="box">
        <h2>Task 2 – Rendering Metadata and Score in HTML</h2>
        <p>
            For the second task I connected this enriched MEI file to the
            <code>metaRAW.html</code> page in my repository. In that file I replaced
            the default example path (<code>data/example.mei</code>) with the path to
            my new MEI file:
        </p>

<pre><code>var meiFile = "data/week7/chopin-cantabile-meta.mei";</code></pre>

        <p>
            When I opened
            <code>[myusername].github.io/MCA-2025/metaRAW.html</code>
            in the browser, the MEI header was displayed as a long block of
            unformatted text above the Verovio score. This shows that the metadata
            is present and readable, but not yet very user friendly.
        </p>

        <h3>How I Would Improve the Formatting</h3>
        <p>
            To make the metadata more usable on the web, I would:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Group the header into sections such as “Work information”,
                “Publication details” and “Licensing”.</li>
            <li>Display important fields (title, composer, genre, licence) as a
                small table or definition list instead of raw text.</li>
            <li>Highlight the licence with a short label
                (e.g. “CC BY-SA 4.0”) and make the link clickable.</li>
            <li>Use CSS to adjust spacing, font size and bold labels so that the
                metadata is easy to skim.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The optional part of the lab suggests two approaches: using CSS with
            CETEIcean (e.g. based on <code>metaCSS1.html</code>) or using
            Javascript (based on <code>metaJS.html</code>). If I extend this work
            later, I would probably use the CSS option, because it keeps the logic
            in the MEI file and styles the existing tags rather than manually
            rebuilding the metadata with Javascript.
        </p>
