        <h1>Week 7 – Curating and Displaying Metadata</h1>
        <p>
            In this lab I revisited the metadata for my dataset theme,
            Frédéric Chopin’s <em>Cantabile in B-flat major, B.84</em>, and focused on
            two things: (1) enriching the MEI header with genre and licensing
            information, and (2) learning how to display that metadata on a web page
            alongside the engraved score using Verovio and CETEIcean.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- TASK 1 -->
    <section class="box">
        <h2>Task 1 – Updating the MEI Metadata</h2>
        <p>
            I began with my Week 5 MEI file and exported a new version for this lab,
            which I saved as <code>chopin-cantabile-meta.mei</code> in my
            <code>data/week7/</code> folder. In this new file I edited the
            <code>&lt;meiHead&gt;</code> to add a genre classification and explicit
            licensing information.
        </p>

        <h3>Genre</h3>
        <p>
            To record the genre, I added an extra annotation inside
            <code>&lt;notesStmt&gt;</code>:
        </p>

<pre><code>&lt;notesStmt&gt;
  &lt;annot&gt;
    Encoded for MCA-2025 metadata work. Schema includes title,
    composer, publisher, date, genre and catalogue number.
  &lt;/annot&gt;
  &lt;annot type="genre"&gt;Character piece (cantabile piano work)&lt;/annot&gt;
&lt;/notesStmt&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>
            I chose the label “character piece (cantabile piano work)” because the
            piece is a short, lyrical solo and is often grouped with Chopin’s other
            intimate character pieces. Recording this in the MEI header means that
            my catalogue could later be filtered or searched by genre as well as by
            composer, key or date.
        </p>

        <h3>Licensing</h3>
        <p>
            I also added licensing information inside <code>&lt;pubStmt&gt;</code>
            using an <code>&lt;availability&gt;</code> element:
        </p>

<pre><code>&lt;pubStmt&gt;
  &lt;publisher&gt;IMSLP- International Music Score Library Project&lt;/publisher&gt;
  &lt;pubPlace&gt;Paris&lt;/pubPlace&gt;
  &lt;date isodate="1834"&gt;1834&lt;/date&gt;

  &lt;availability&gt;
    Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
    (CC BY-SA 4.0). See: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
  &lt;/availability&gt;
&lt;/pubStmt&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>
            I chose a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 licence because
            the original score is in the public domain, but I still want to encourage
            proper attribution of the encoding and allow others to reuse and adapt it
            as long as they share any derivatives under the same open licence. This is
            a realistic choice for an educational and research-oriented dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
            After these changes I checked the header in the Verovio XML view and
            adjusted the structure (for example, placing <code>&lt;availability&gt;</code>
            inside <code>&lt;pubStmt&gt;</code>) until no red validation errors
            remained.
        </p>

        <p>
            My updated MEI file for this lab is:
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="../data/week7/chopin-meta.mei">
                Download Week 7 Cantabile MEI file
            </a>
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="box">
        <h2>Task 2 – Rendering Metadata and Score on the Web</h2>
        <p>
            For the second task I connected this enriched MEI file to the
            <code>metaRAW.html</code> page provided in the repository. In that file I
            replaced the example path with the location of my new MEI file, e.g.:
        </p>

<pre><code>var meiFile = "data/week7/chopin-meta.mei";</code></pre>

        <p>
            When I opened
            <code>useruseruser22f.github.io/MCA-2025/metaRAW.html</code>
            in the browser, CETEIcean rendered the MEI header as a block of
            unformatted text above the Verovio score. This confirmed that my metadata
            was correctly encoded and being read, but it also showed that the default
            display is not very user friendly.
        </p>

        <h3>How I Would Format the Metadata</h3>
        <p>
            To make the metadata more readable for visitors to the site, I would:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Group related fields into sections such as “Work details” (title,
                composer, genre), “Publication” (publisher, place, date), and
                “Licensing”.</li>
            <li>Use headings and a simple table or list to separate labels
                (e.g. “Composer:”) from their values.</li>
            <li>Highlight the licence as a short badge (for example “CC BY-SA 4.0”)
                and make the URL to the Creative Commons page clickable.</li>
            <li>Apply CSS (for example in <code>CETEIcean.css</code>) to adjust font
                sizes, margins and spacing so the metadata block feels like a
                clean information panel rather than a chunk of text.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The optional part of the lab suggests using either CSS (via templates
            like <code>metaCSS1.html</code>) or Javascript (via
            <code>metaJS.html</code>) to format the metadata automatically.
            If I extend this work later, I will probably choose the CSS-based
            approach, because it lets me keep the structure in MEI and simply change
            how those elements are displayed, rather than rebuilding the metadata
            manually in Javascript.
