<h1>Week 5 — Metadata Schema & MEI Enrichment</h1>

<h2>My Metadata Schema</h2>
<p>
For my music catalogue, I created a metadata schema with the following elements.
This schema ensures that every piece in my dataset — starting with Chopin’s
<i>Cantabile in B-flat major, B.84</i> — can be described consistently.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Title</strong> – the official title of the piece.</li>
    <li><strong>Composer</strong> – name of the composer, linked to an authority record when possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Publisher</strong> – publisher of the score used for encoding.</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Composition</strong> – year the piece was composed.</li>
    <li><strong>Genre</strong> – musical category.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These five elements satisfy the requirement of having at least five metadata fields,
including the three required ones: title, artist, and publisher.
