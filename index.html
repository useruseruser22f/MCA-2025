        <p><em>Task 2 – Dataset Theme: Frédéric Chopin</em></p>

        <p>
            For my dataset theme, I have selected <strong>Frédéric Chopin (1810–1849)</strong>, the Polish composer and pianist
            known primarily for his solo piano works. Chopin is an ideal subject for a curated dataset because:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>His notated music (scores, manuscripts, engravings) is widely available and in the public domain.</li>
            <li>High-quality audio recordings exist from numerous performers, including historical, classical, and modern interpretations.</li>
            <li>Well-structured metadata – such as opus numbers, dates of composition, keys, and catalog systems – is extensively documented.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Chopin’s body of work includes nocturnes, waltzes, mazurkas, études, preludes, ballades, and polonaises,
            all of which offer rich material for analysis and dataset creation.

        <h2>Task 3 – Challenges of Working With Music Data &amp; How They Apply to Chopin</h2>

        <h3>General Challenges in Music Data</h3>
        <p>Working with music-related data often involves several difficulties:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Access limitations:</strong>
                Modern works may be under copyright, restricting score access, but even public-domain music can be scattered
                across archives with inconsistent availability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Metadata inconsistency:</strong>
                Different archives may use different labeling systems (opus numbers vs. alternative catalogues),
                making cross-referencing difficult.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Version variability:</strong>
                Musical works often exist in multiple editions, arrangements, or performances, which complicates dataset standardisation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Format fragmentation:</strong>
                Scores may come as PDFs, MusicXML, or MIDI; audio might be MP3, WAV, or streaming-only; metadata may appear
                in CSV, JSON, or embedded within websites.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Curation challenges:</strong>
                Music collections are often spread across different repositories such as IMSLP, libraries, and streaming platforms,
                requiring manual gathering and verification.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges Specific to Chopin</h3>
        <p>Chopin’s music is widely documented, but it still presents unique challenges:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Multiple editions and editorial revisions:</strong>
                Chopin did not always leave definitive versions of his works, leading to disparities between early French,
                German, and English editions. This makes it challenging to choose which score should be the “authoritative” one for a dataset.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Variant cataloguing systems:</strong>
                Different scholars (e.g., Brown, Kobylanski, Chomiński) have assigned different catalog numbers to certain works.
                Metadata across sources may not align.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Interpretive diversity in recordings:</strong>
                Chopin’s music relies heavily on performance nuance, such as rubato and pedal usage. Audio datasets may vary
                significantly depending on performer style and recording quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Manuscript availability:</strong>
                Some manuscripts are incomplete, damaged, or scattered across private collections and museums.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Chopin Data Is Currently Curated</h3>

        <p><strong>Scores:</strong> Most public-domain scores are curated by digital libraries such as IMSLP, The Chopin Institute, and various national library archives. They provide PDFs, scans of original manuscripts, and sometimes MusicXML or MIDI formats.</p>

        <p><strong>Audio:</strong> Recordings are distributed across streaming platforms (Spotify, YouTube, Naxos), and performers often release multiple interpretations of the same piece. Archival recordings from early pianists preserve historical performance styles.</p>

        <p><strong>Metadata:</strong> Musicological organisations and databases (MusicBrainz, The Chopin National Edition, library catalogues) curate metadata that includes opus numbers, catalog numbers, composition dates, keys, and editorial notes.</p>

        <p>
            Chopin’s data landscape is rich but multi-layered, and the presence of many editions, interpretations, and cataloguing systems
            makes curation both complex and rewarding.
