<!-- Version 1.0 -->
 Task 2 - Dataset Theme: Frédéric Chopin

For my dataset theme, I have selected Frédéric Chopin (1810–1849), the Polish composer and pianist known primarily for his solo piano works. Chopin is an ideal subject for a curated dataset because:

His notated music (scores, manuscripts, engravings) is widely available and in the public domain.

High-quality audio recordings exist from numerous performers, including historical, classical, and modern interpretations.

Well-structured metadata, such as opus numbers, dates of composition, keys, catalog systems (e.g., Opus, Bjørn, Brown, Kobylanski)—is extensively documented.

Chopin’s body of work includes nocturnes, waltzes, mazurkas, études, preludes, ballades, and polonaises, all of which offer rich material for analysis and dataset creation.

Task 3 - Challenges of Working With Music Data & How They Apply to Chopin
General Challenges in Music Data

Working with music-related data often involves several difficulties:

Access limitations

Modern works may be under copyright, restricting score access, but even public-domain music can be scattered across archives with inconsistent availability.

Metadata inconsistency

Different archives may use different labeling systems (opus numbers vs. alternative catalogs), making cross-referencing difficult.

Version variability

Musical works often exist in multiple editions, arrangements, or performances, which complicates dataset standardization.

Format fragmentation

Scores may come as PDFs, MusicXML, or MIDI; audio might be MP3, WAV, or streaming-only; metadata may appear in CSV, JSON, or embedded within websites.

Curation challenges

Music collections are often spread across different repositories (IMSLP, libraries, streaming platforms), requiring manual gathering and verification.

Challenges Specific to Chopin

Chopin’s music is widely documented, but it still presents unique challenges:

Multiple editions and editorial revisions: Chopin did not always leave definitive versions of his works, leading to disparities between early French, German, and English editions. This makes it challenging to choose which score should be the “authoritative” one for a dataset.

Variant cataloging systems: Different scholars (e.g., Brown, Kobylanski, Chomiński) have assigned different catalog numbers to certain works. Metadata across sources may not align.

Interpretive diversity in recordings: Chopin’s music relies heavily on performance nuance (rubato, pedal usage). Audio datasets may vary significantly depending on performer style and recording quality.

Manuscript availability: Some manuscripts are incomplete, damaged, or scattered across private collections and museums.

How Chopin Data Is Currently Curated

Scores: Most public-domain scores are curated by digital libraries such as IMSLP, The Chopin Institute, and various national library archives. They provide PDFs, scans of original manuscripts, and sometimes MusicXML or MIDI formats.

Audio: Recordings are distributed across streaming platforms (Spotify, YouTube, Naxos), and performers often release multiple interpretations of the same piece. Archival recordings from early pianists preserve historical performance styles.

Metadata: Musicological organisations and databases (MusicBrainz, The Chopin National Edition, library catalogues) curate metadata that includes opus numbers, catalog numbers, composition dates, keys, and editorial notes.

Chopin’s data landscape is rich but multi-layered, and the presence of many editions, interpretations, and cataloging systems makes curation both complex and rewarding.
